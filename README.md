# Intuder Alarm
Academic Project for the Embedded Systems course.

In this project I've the opportunity to learn and practice with the Forth programming language.
This language is stack-based and it's efficient but less powerful than modern Embedded programming langugages.

The purpose of the project was to interact with a new and different programming paradigm looking at how the registers works and how the code flow can be made with a low-level strategy.
